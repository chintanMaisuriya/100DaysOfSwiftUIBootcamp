This project is build to detailing some of the history, the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program named as 'Moonshot'. 

* While creating this project, We learned following things:
    * Resizing images to fit the available space with the usage of containerRelativeFrame()
    * Use of the ScrollView
    * Use NavigationLink to push new views onto the navigation stack
    * Use Codable data along with the usage of generics
    * Storing user settings with UserDefaults
    * Archiving Swift objects with Codable
    

# Challenges 

1. Add the launch date to MissionView, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you.
2. Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in MissionView is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the Rectangle dividers out too.
3. For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to ContentView that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.
