This project is a 'WordScramble' game, and it will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it.

* While creating this project, We learned following things:
    * Create a List
    * Perform tasks when view appears using 'onAppear' modifier
    * Use of Bundle resources
    * Use of UITextChecker to validate words
    * Use of fatalError to force code to shut down when something impossible has happened


# Challenges 

1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
