This is the technique project, and we learned about SwiftData and explored how SwiftData and SwiftUI work together to help us build great apps.

* We learned about  :
    * SwiftData: Introduction
    * Editing SwiftData model objects
    * Filtering @Query using Predicate
    * Dynamically sorting and filtering @Query with SwiftUI
    * Relationships with SwiftData, SwiftUI, and @Query
    * Syncing SwiftData with CloudKit
