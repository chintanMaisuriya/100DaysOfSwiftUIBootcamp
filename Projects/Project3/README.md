This is the technique project, and we learned two fundamental components of SwiftUI: views and modifiers.

* We learned about  :
    * The actual reasons of using structs for views in SwiftUI. 
    * What is behind the main SwiftUI view?
    * Why modifier order matters
    * Why does SwiftUI use “some View” for its view type?
    * Conditional and Environment modifiers
    * Views as properties
    * View composition
    * Custom modifiers
