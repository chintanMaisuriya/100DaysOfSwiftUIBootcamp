This project is a 'BetterRest', and it’s designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them following three questions:
    * When do they want to wake up?
    * Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
    * How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?
Once user answers this three questions, the application feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed. 

* We learned about:
    * Create a form using Text, DatePicker, Stepper, Picker
    * Get insights about Machine learning using iOS frameworks such as CreateML and CoreML
