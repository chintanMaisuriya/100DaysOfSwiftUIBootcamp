This project is a 'Guess the Flag' app that is a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world. While creating this project we learnt following things so far:

* This project introduce us to whole range of new SwiftUI functionality: stacks, buttons, images, alerts, asset catalogs, and more.
* To compose complex layouts from primitive container views, we can use stack views in SwiftUI
    * There are three types of stack views in SwiftUI: HStack, VStack, and ZStack 
    * The HStack is used to stack views horizontally. Just like the VStack, you can set the alignment and space items.
    * The VStack allows you to stack views vertically, from top to bottom. You can further customize the view by adding alignment or spacing to the VStack.
    * ZStack is great for overlapping content. It stacks layers on top of each other, in a 3 dimentional plane. Since elements can float on top of each other, the alignment for ZStack will move all items at one. This is useful for creating overlapping contents, like placing a text on top of an image like this:
    * SPACER: By default, stacks in SwiftUI will take the minimum space and align to the center. The Spacer is essential for pushing the content to use the maximum space. It can be useful for aligning elements as well.
* Gradients: LinearGradient, RadialGradient and AngularGradient
* Learned more customization over button like adding role, title, actions, etc...
* Showing alert messages
